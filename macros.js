/**
 * Macro injection: registers Smart Memory content as SillyTavern macros.
 *
 * Each memory tier exposes a {{smartmemory-*}} macro that injects its content
 * wherever the user places the token in a character card or instruct template.
 * Inject functions update the cache on every call so macros always return
 * fresh content without requiring a separate generation pass.
 *
 * The unified macro (smartmemory-unified) is a special case: it is only active
 * when unified injection is also on, and its content is the merged block produced
 * by injectUnified rather than a single tier. Individual tier macros are inactive
 * when unified injection is on - unified owns those tiers.
 *
 * MACRO_NAMES              - canonical macro name strings for all 11 macros
 * setMacroContent          - stores tier content in the cache (called by inject fns)
 * isMacroActive            - true when the macro should handle placement for a tier
 * registerSmartMemoryMacros - registers all 10 macros with the ST macro system at init
