// A fixed roleplay scenario designed to exercise all three extraction tiers.
// Rich enough that a capable model should produce multiple items per tier;
// long enough to surface models that degrade on larger prompts.
export const TEST_CHARACTERS = ['Yara', 'Cael'];

// A post-armistice occupied city. Yara is a former resistance fighter looking
// for her brother Daven, who went into hiding after the war ended and has now
// gone missing. Cael is an intelligence operative officially working for the
// occupation authority, secretly helping Yara.
//
// Designed so that all three story arcs open clearly but NONE resolve within
// the conversation - the brother is not found, the surveillance tail is not
// identified, Cael's handler does not discover him. This prevents the model
// from confusing established facts with open threads.
